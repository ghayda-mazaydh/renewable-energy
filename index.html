    <h2> Theory
        <p>
                The solar cell works in several steps:

               - Photons in sunlight hit the solar panel and are absorbed by semiconducting materials, such as silicon.
               - Electrons are excited from their current molecular/atomic orbital. Once excited an electron can either dissipate the energy as heat and return to its orbital or travel through the cell until it reaches an electrode. Current flows through the material to cancel the potential and this electricity is captured. The chemical bonds of the material are vital for this process to work, and usually silicon is used in two layers, one layer being doped with boron, the other phosphorus. These layers have different chemical electric charges and subsequently both drive and direct the current of electrons.
               - An array of solar cells converts solar energy into a usable amount of direct current (DC) electricity.
              -  An inverter can convert the power to alternating current (AC).

            The most commonly known solar cell is configured as a large-area pâ€“n junction made from silicon. Other possible solar cell types are organic solar cells, dye sensitized solar cells, perovskite solar cells, quantum dot solar cells etc. The illuminated side of a solar cell generally has a transparent conducting film for allowing light to enter into active material and to collect the generated charge carriers. Typically, films with high transmittance and high electrical conductance such as indium tin oxide, conducting polymers or conducting nanowire networks are used for the purpose
